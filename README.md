Welcome to GeoGram a social media app focused on our surroundings.
Technolgies used : Mongoose/MongoDb, Express, React, Node.js
This app's goal is to show the user beautiful photos, inspiring them to get outside and start an adventure.
A big part of the building experience for me was manipulating arrays and object to return the desired posts and post data
I originally planned to have the user follow locations to furth emphasize the focus on environment.
This plan was overturned sunday(the day before this is do) as I figured a lack of uniform titling could lead to inconsistency in posts

In the future I hope to incorporate an api for location autofill autocomplete which could help solve the the problem above
I also want to spend more time styling and building out profile pages as I feel the tabs are too similar to each other
I did not reach the vision I had for this project and I will likely work on it more in the near future
React Router will be super helpful for this app and I looke forward to implementing it
